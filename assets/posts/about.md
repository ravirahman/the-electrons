The Electrons (RSS Team 12) are comprised of five MIT undergraduates (left to right): [Jerry Wu](#jerry), [Kolby Danner](#kolby), [Marek Subernat](#marek), [Sabina Chen](#sabina), and [Ravi Rahman](#ravi). The team varies in experience, but overall shares a genuine interest in topics around autonomy, path planning, computer vision, and control systems. Our diverse interests will lead towards

**Jerry Wu** is a senior double majoring in Math and Computer Science and originally from Fremont, California. His expertise is primarily in algorithms, with some performance engineering and machine learning experience. After graduation, Jerry plans to work for Google in Mountain View, though he is not currently decided whether he will stay at Google after a year or move on to Berkeley's Computer Science PhD program.

**Ravi Rahman**, an MIT Computer Science and Electrical Engineering (6-2) sophomore and Mathematics minor, specializes in algorithm design and full stack development. From this class, he wants to understand how to design autonomous systems. In addition, his coursework this semester includes machine learning and managerial finance. Last summer, Ravi interened at Illumio, a cybersecurity startup located in Sunnyvale, CA. Currently, he researches in MIT CSAIL's Distributed Robotics Lab, and he will working at Uber in San Francisco this upcoming summer.

Beyond academics, his interests include competing in hackathons, playing squash, skiing, and traveling.
