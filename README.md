## Notes for the future

### Creating lab reports

You will see that there is a template for a lab report titled **lab3.md**. As you can see, the post is written using Markdown. If you've never used Markdown before, you can find a cheatsheet here: 

[https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#code](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#code).

Also, LaTex is supported! Many of the reports will require you to display equations: delineate LaTex equations by wrapping them with $$ (e.g. $$\frac{1}{2}$$) and they will be converted to LaTex when the website loads.

*Note: This will work best when the LaTex equations are on their own lines.*

There are [plenty](https://stackedit.io/app) [of](https://dillinger.io/) [tools](http://jbt.github.io/markdown-editor/) to work in Markdown. For future labs, create your lab reports using markdown, and save them as **lab[#].md** within the **posts** folder, and the HTML will automatically be created for your website.

Feel free to use plenty of pictures, gifs, and videos in your lab reports! No one likes reading blocks and blocks of text.

### Linking the lab presentations

In the **index.html** file, there are links to lab presentations that are unfinished. As you create lab presentations, make sure to link to them on your website.

### Video

Eventually, you will create a final video for the class. This is what the video button will eventually link to.

If you'd like, you can link to a YouTube channel where you can post multiple videos of the car! We only expect to have the final video linked. 	

### A note on pictures

Make sure that the pictures you use are relatively lightweight. It's not uncommon to use PNG for most images on websites so that they load faster.
